# What is the EulerProject?
A set of fun & difficult cs problems. You can find them here: https://projecteuler.net/


# What is this Repo?
In this repository, I will try to solve some of the recent problems posted from https://projecteuler.net/ for fun. I am planning to solve them using python, as that is what I am most familiar with. 

If you are interested in working on some of these problems, just DM me on my social media or email me at darrowrhartman@gmail.com. 

If you plan to use the code written in this project, please credit this repo. Thanks!
